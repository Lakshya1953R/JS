// convert null into a number treating it as 0
console.log(null==0) // equality check (==) does not converts null into a number 
console.log(null>=0);
// same does not happens for "undefined" it is not 
// converted into number by any comparsion


// === means strict check that is it also check the value`s datatype

console.log("2" === 2);
// it gives false because as it checks the datatypes are different 
// which means they are not compareable hence the output is false
